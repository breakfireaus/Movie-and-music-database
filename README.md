# Movie Makers Soundtrack Database

## Description

Welcome to the Movie Makers Soundtrack Database, The purpose of this site is for users to search for the music soundtracks of movies they have love or have watched or have an interest for. This was a project that was not made by 1 individual but a collaboration of 3 individuals who were studying a bootcamp of coding. This was our first ever team project in the world of IT and finding the balance of our everyday lives and working as a team in IT, lots of learning. It was a great experience, challenging and very rewarding as we have only been coding for 8 weeks.
