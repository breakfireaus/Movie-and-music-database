# Movie Makers Mine

## Description

Welcome to the Movie Makers Mine, The purpose of this project was to create a one-stop-shop for movie enthusiasts to find a goldmine of information about their favourite movies.  The site currently allows users to search a movie title and find information about the movie plotline and ratings.

Further development will involve calling on additional APIs to allow movie enthusiasts to watch the movie's trailer, listen to the movie's soundtrack, read famous quotes from the movie and find information about the movie's cast and other interesting tidbits!
